~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~CREATIVE TITLE~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So you've got a city full of people, and some of them have a nondescript plague, which is unfortunate.
Without intervention the plague will spread to everone and then they will die. This is bad, because when
people die you lose money, and when you run out of money you lose the game, and that is of course bad.
Also dead people can't do work, which means you get less money, which is extra bad.

Thus, in order to stop the nondescript plague, you have several things that you can build. These structures
are built by clicking the corresponding button, and then clicking where you want to put them. If you change
your mind, right click to clear your selection.

The most basic of these constructions are walls. Walls stop people from going places, because people can't 
go through walls. This could be useful in quarantining or streamlining people as you see fit.

For even more capable quaranting, there is the sorter. This handy device only allows people to go past in one
direction, and then splits them into people who are infected with the plague and people who are healthy. This
is slightly time consuming, beware of traffic jams.

In order to properly treat the disease, hospitals and treatment centers can be built. Anyone infected with the
plague who passes near either of these buildings will go into them and recieve medical attention. Hospitals can
reduce the symptoms of the plague, but cannot actually cure it. Treatment centers can cure the disease, but only
if the symptoms are significantly reduced. For this reason, they are only effective if the disease is caught very
early, or if ample hospital care is provided. For every patient treated at either of these facilities, you
must pay some expense.

If you wish to destroy a building that you have placed, the bulldoze option can be used. This will refund a portion
of the building's price. The bulldoze tool can also be used to remove corpses, which is convenient because corpses
are very good at spreading the plague.


~~~~~~~RANDOM THINGS THAT YOU DON'T TECHNICALLY NEED TO KNOW BUT MAY BE OF INTEREST~~~~~~~

The green buildings are houses, the red buildings are workplaces, and the blue buildings are generic recreational places.
People will go to their house and/or recreational areas in order to keep their personal sleep and/or happiness above
a certain level, and will otherwise go to their workplace. This is good, because they only make you money at work,
so expect income to drop if you barricade work buildings. 

The settings at the start of the game define the starting population and basic plague characteristics. The population
is fairly obvious, and the initial infected is just the number of people who start off with the plague.
Growth rate is how quickly the plague progresses in an individual. A growth rate of 0 won't do anything every,
a growth rate of 1 will kill a person the second they contract the plague. Infection rate is the chance
for everyone around a plague victim to become infected with the plague. This chance is calculated every
few seconds, and corresponds with the particles that can be seen coming from infected people.

Feel free to mess with these values pretty dramatically and see what happens, I haven't really seen how the gameplay
works at various settings, although performance might have some issues if the defaults are exceeded dramatically.
Enjoy!
